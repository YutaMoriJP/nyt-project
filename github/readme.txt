This is just a test project to see if we can successfully create our GIT project, by creating the Git repository, so our git project, create a file in our working directory where the job is to add, edit, delete, and organize files. Then once we have made changes to our file, we need to add our file to the staging area so the file is staged for a committ and git starts to track changes. we can check if a file is staged for a committ and if git is tracking changes, if we make new updates then that change is not staged for a committ, so in order for that change to be staged for a committ, we run the command git add filename. And then to commit our file, so push the file to the repositry, a place where file versions are permanently stored in that repository. We run the command git commit -m first commit. were saving our file to the git repository.
